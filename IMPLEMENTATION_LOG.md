## 2026-03-23 · F-01 · Database Schema & Migrations

**What was built:** Plain SQL migration file creating all six domain tables (`tests`, `test_runs`, `assertion_results`, `uptime_daily`, `notification_channels`, `test_state`) with constraints, indexes, and monthly range partitioning on `test_runs`. A `tsx`-based migration runner tracks applied migrations via a `schema_migrations` table and runs each file in a transaction.

**Files changed:**
- `apps/api/src/db/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` — full DDL for all tables and initial partitions
- `apps/api/src/db/migrate.ts` — migration runner script
- `apps/api/src/config.ts` — exports `DATABASE_URL` from env (single env-var entry point per RULES.md)
- `apps/api/package.json` — added `"migrate": "tsx src/db/migrate.ts"` script

**Decisions:**
- `test_runs` PK is `(id, started_at)` because Postgres requires the partition key in every unique constraint on a partitioned table.
- No hard FK from `assertion_results` → `test_runs`: enforcing it would require `started_at` in `assertion_results`, which the domain model doesn't include. Integrity is application-enforced.
- Monthly partitions are created via a `DO` block at apply-time so filenames are calendar-correct without hardcoding dates.

**Deferred:** Logic to create new monthly partitions automatically (needed for F-06 daily aggregation job).
